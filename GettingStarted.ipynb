    "# Understanding MCP: Model Context Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive lesson on Model Context Protocol (MCP)! As a complete beginner, you'll gain a thorough understanding of MCP, its applications, and by the end, you'll even have a simple implementation you can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework that enables AI models to access and process external information beyond their training data. It allows AI systems to retrieve, analyze, and manipulate external context—such as files, databases, websites, and APIs—to generate more accurate, relevant, and up-to-date responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of MCP as a bridge that connects AI models to the outside world of information. Rather than being limited to what they were trained on, models can now \"reach out\" to access specific information they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How MCP Works\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP operates through several core components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Providers**: These are modules that connect to external data sources (like files, APIs, databases, or websites) and convert that information into a format the model can process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Router**: This component determines which provider to use based on the user's query and manages the flow of information between providers and the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool Integration**: MCP integrates with various tools that extend the model's capabilities, allowing it to perform actions like running code, making calculations, or searching for information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reasoning Engine**: This component helps the model decide when and how to use external information to answer questions, ensuring relevance and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical MCP workflow looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A user submits a query\n",
    "2. The context router analyzes the query and selects appropriate context providers\n",
    "3. Context providers fetch relevant information from external sources\n",
    "4. The reasoning engine integrates this information with the model's knowledge\n",
    "5. The model generates a response that incorporates this external context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World MCP Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP has led to numerous practical applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Assistants**: GitHub Copilot and similar tools use MCP to understand codebases, suggest code completions, and help developers navigate large projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Research Agents**: Tools like Elicit and ScisummBot use MCP to search academic papers, extract relevant information, and synthesize findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customer Support Systems**: Companies deploy MCP-powered assistants that can access customer records, product documentation, and internal knowledge bases to provide personalized support.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Analysis Tools**: Systems that can connect to databases and visualization tools to perform statistical analysis and generate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Web Research Assistants**: Tools that can browse the web, extract information from websites, and compile research on specific topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Document Processors**: Systems that can parse, analyze, and extract information from various document formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use the MCP GitHub Repository Analyzer\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCP system I've provided can analyze GitHub repositories or websites and answer questions about them. Here's how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**:\n",
    "   - Install the required libraries: `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 langchain openai chromadb`\n",
    "   - Set your OpenAI API key in the environment variables\n",
    "   - Run the script\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading a Source**:\n",
    "   - When prompted, enter a GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook`) or a website URL\n",
    "   - The system will fetch and index the content\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Asking Questions**:\n",
    "   - Choose option 1 to ask questions about the loaded source\n",
    "   - The system will retrieve relevant information and answer your question\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generating Code**:\n",
    "   - Choose option 2 to request code for a new feature\n",
    "   - Describe the feature, and the system will generate code that's compatible with the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key MCP Concepts You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Providers**: The system includes providers for GitHub repositories and websites, demonstrating how MCP can access different external data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Routing**: The router determines which provider to use based on the URL, showing how MCP systems intelligently direct queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Retrieval**: The system splits content into chunks, creates embeddings, and uses vector search to find relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Generation**: The system uses retrieved context to generate accurate answers and code suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tool Integration**: The system demonstrates how MCP can integrate with external tools (GitHub API, web scraping) to extend capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is simplified for educational purposes. Production MCP systems would include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More robust error handling and rate limiting\n",
    "- Support for more data sources and file formats\n",
    "- More sophisticated context routing algorithms\n",
    "- Better document processing and chunking strategies\n",
    "- Integration with more tools and APIs\n",
    "- Security measures for data access\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "You now understand the core concepts of Model Context Protocol (MCP) and have a working example that demonstrates these principles. The system I've provided can connect to external sources (GitHub repositories and websites), process their content, and use that context to answer questions and generate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you continue exploring MCP, you might want to extend this system by adding more context providers, improving the retrieval mechanism, or integrating with additional tools and APIs.\n"
